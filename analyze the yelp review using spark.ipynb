The \\\\&quot;Man O\\&apos;War\\\\&quot; quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. \\\\nThe only big miss on their beers I\\&apos;ve had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  \\\\nNonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn\\&apos;t had from them would be top notch... and they are! \\\\nThe reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! \\\\nThe servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! \\\\nAfter another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. \\\\nThis is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn\\&apos;t seem very pleased when leaving. \\\\nThe toast &amp; cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.&quot;, &quot;date&quot;: &quot;2015-01-18 14:04:18&quot;, &quot;KaggleID&quot;: 1}&apos;]\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\npd.Series([1,2,3])[0]"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"><span class=\"ansired\">Out[</span><span class=\"ansired\">7</span><span class=\"ansired\">]: </span>1\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":3}],"metadata":{"name":"analyze the yelp review","notebookId":3182772806793431},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
